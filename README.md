What? Uhm, yeah, I'll revive, remake and rebrand the unofficial Alles Micro I was making a few months ago. 

Why?

- In the past months I've learned A LOT about Android development, it'd be just a pain to be refactoring code so 
I'd rather make everything from scratch
- This name seemed cooler and more original than the previous one

When? idk, when I have time. I'm currently maintaining Talon and Ruby (Peroxaan apps) for Android, and also I 
have school now. You'll be able to see the progress in here (and maybe I'll set up GitHub Actions to compile a 
debug APK everytime I finish a feature so you can test everything early c;)

Questions? You can reach me in my Twitter DMs or Telegram (or Discord in case we have a mutual server because I 
don't think Discord lets users just randomly message someone who doesn't have anything in common?)
